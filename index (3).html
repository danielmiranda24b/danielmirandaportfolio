    <h1>Daniel Miranda</h1>
    <p>
      I'm 19 and currently in my second semester of freshman year, pursuing a dual degree in Computational Science and STEM Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. I’m from Parkland, Florida, and proudly a child of God.

      My ultimate goal is to build <a href="future.html">one of the world’s leading tech consulting firms</a>, focused on innovation and automation. We’ll help companies optimize everything—from product development to internal systems—earning our value through results. Whether it’s engineering a better product or temporarily stepping in as C-suite executives, we’ll work across industries to make impactful change.

      With AI, I sometimes feel less but my output greater. I’ll sacrifice my ego for the betterment of the world. Success doesn’t require selling your soul. “What does it profit a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?” – Mark 8:36) When I pray for the world, I’ll be praying for you too, pray for me.

      This site began as a class project, but it's now a digital diary of my life’s mission. You're welcome, future historians.
